A selection of the artist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seminal works is presented alongside written contributions from local and international art critics and curators. The book on Manal AlDowayan is an intimate exploration of her participatory approach to art, which addresses the crucial topic of gender-specific, socio-political obstacles and narratives in Saudi Arabia. Hassan Sharif's book examines the concept of weaving throughout his oeuvre, which became as much a conceptual approach as it was a performative action.",
